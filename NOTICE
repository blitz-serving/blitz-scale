The HTTP server logic in the router module of Blitzscale is based on [Text-Generation-Inference].
Modifications made by <Blitz-serving> are:
- Added new interfaces to support manual scale-up and scale-down operations
- Enlarge schedule from single instance to distributed multi-instance scenario, and completely replaced the scheduling module with Blitzscale-specific strategies, including PD disaggregation and Zigzag scheduling
- Completely replace the serving backend (GPU-attach process), and implement in C++. 
- Introduced a monitor-trigger automatic scaling mechanism
